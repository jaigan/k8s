# Managing Secrets in Helm Charts

Managing secrets in Helm charts is critical for ensuring that sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, and credentials, are stored and accessed securely. This document covers several methods to handle secrets in Helm charts based on your environment and security requirements.

## 1. Kubernetes Secrets (Basic Approach)

Kubernetes natively supports secrets through the `Secret` object, which can be integrated into Helm charts. Note that secrets are base64-encoded but **not encrypted** by default, so consider this approach for less sensitive information.

### Steps:
1. **Define Secret in Helm Values (`values.yaml`):**
    ```yaml
    secrets:
      dbPassword: "yourpassword"
    ```

2. **Create a Secret Template (`secret.yaml`):**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: {{ .Release.Name }}-secret
    type: Opaque
    data:
      db-password: {{ .Values.secrets.dbPassword | b64enc | quote }}
    ```

3. **Reference the Secret in Deployment:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: {{ .Release.Name }}-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:latest
          env:
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-secret
                  key: db-password
    ```

This method injects the password from the secret into your pod as an environment variable.

## 2. Using External Secrets Management Solutions

For more secure and automated management, you can integrate Helm with external secrets management tools like **HashiCorp Vault**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, or **SOPS**.

### a. HashiCorp Vault
1. **Set up Vault with Kubernetes Auth.**
2. **Install Vault Helm chart:**
   ```bash
   helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
   helm install vault hashicorp/vault
   ```

3. **Inject Vault Secrets into Deployment:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     annotations:
       vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
       vault.hashicorp.com/role: "myapp-role"
       vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-db-password: "secret/data/db#password"
   spec:
     containers:
       - name: myapp
         env:
           - name: DB_PASSWORD
             value: /vault/secrets/db-password
   ```

### b. AWS Secrets Manager
1. **Install AWS Secrets and Config Provider for Kubernetes:**
   ```bash
   helm repo add aws-secrets-manager https://aws.github.io/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws
   helm install aws-secrets-manager aws-secrets-manager/aws-secrets-manager
   ```

2. **Reference AWS Secrets Manager in your Helm Chart:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     annotations:
       secrets-store.csi.k8s.io/used: "true"
   spec:
     containers:
     - env:
         - name: DB_PASSWORD
           valueFrom:
             secretKeyRef:
               name: aws-secrets-manager
               key: my-db-password
   ```

### c. SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)
1. **Encrypt Secret using SOPS:**
   ```bash
   sops -e secrets.yaml > secrets.enc.yaml
   ```

2. **Decrypt during Helm deployment using post-render hook:**
   Add the decrypted secret in your `values.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   secrets:
     enabled: true
     file: secrets.enc.yaml
   ```

---

## 3. Helm Secrets Plugin

The [Helm Secrets Plugin](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets) allows you to use SOPS for encrypted secret management within Helm.

### Steps:
1. **Install the Plugin:**
   ```bash
   helm plugin install https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets
   ```

2. **Encrypt Secrets using SOPS:**
   ```bash
   sops -e values.secret.yaml > values.secret.enc.yaml
   ```

3. **Deploy Helm Chart with Encrypted Secrets:**
   ```bash
   helm secrets upgrade --install myrelease ./mychart -f values.secret.enc.yaml
   ```

---

## 4. Sealed Secrets (Bitnami)

[Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) is a Bitnami project that encrypts Kubernetes secrets, allowing them to be safely committed to version control.

### Steps:
1. **Install the Sealed Secrets Controller:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.17.4/controller.yaml
   ```

2. **Create a Sealed Secret:**
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD=mydbpassword --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal > sealedsecret.yaml
   ```

3. **Use Sealed Secret in Helm Chart:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
   kind: SealedSecret
   metadata:
     name: mysecret
   spec:
     encryptedData:
       db-password: {{ .Values.sealedSecrets.dbPassword }}
   ```

---

## Best Practices:
- **Use RBAC and Namespace Isolation**: Ensure that only the necessary services can access the secrets.
- **Avoid Storing Plaintext Secrets**: Never store plaintext secrets directly in your `values.yaml` or Helm templates. Use encryption or sealed secrets instead.
- **Rotate Secrets Regularly**: Automate the process of rotating secrets, especially for long-running services.

## Conclusion

Choose the method that aligns with your security requirements and operational complexity. Each solution has trade-offs, so it's important to weigh ease of use against the level of security you need.
